presented as part of MP429: New Medicines, Better Medicines, Better Use of Medicines, at the University of Strathclyde.

The material you are viewing relates to the 2020-21 presentation of the course, and was prepared by

- [Dr Leighton Pritchard](https://github.com/widdowquinn)
- [Dr Nik Rattray](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/rattraynicholasdr/)
- [Dr Zahra Rattray](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/rattrayzahradr/)

## How Do I Use This Repository?

We use the code in this repository to generate 

1. standalone HTML files that can be used with MyPlace. 
2. [`Shiny`]() webapps that can be run by students on their own machines, or at [`rstudio.org`]()

The code is written in [`R`]() using [`R Markdown`](), and to use or generate all of the materials, we recommend that you install and use [`RStudio`]().

In addition, the materials require the following `R` packages:

- [`DT]() for interactive data tables in standalone HTML pages
- [`plotly`]() for interactive graphs in standalone HTML pages

and these can be installed from `RStudio` by opening the script and clicking on the `Run` button, or from the command-line using:

```bash
Rscript install.R
```
