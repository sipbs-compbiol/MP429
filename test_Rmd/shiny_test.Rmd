library(viridis)
```

You've seen the Maunga Whau volcano displayed in a variety of colors. Now pick your favorite.

```{r echo = FALSE}
selectInput("colors", "Choose a color palette", 
  choices = c("viridis", "magma", "inferno", "plasma", "heat",
  "terrain", "topographic", "cyan/magenta", "rainbow"))

colorPalette <- reactive({
  switch(input$colors, 
         "viridis" = viridis(200),
         "magma" = viridis(200, option = "A"),
         "inferno" = viridis(200, option = "B"),
         "plasma" = viridis(200, option = "C"),
         "heat" = heat.colors(200),
         "terrain" = terrain.colors(200),
         "topographic" = topo.colors(200),
         "cyan/magenta" = cm.colors(200),
         "rainbow" = rainbow(200))
})

renderPlot({
  image(volcano, col = colorPalette())
})
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
